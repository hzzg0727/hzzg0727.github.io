<p>Assume dealing with optical frequencies, in which case we can treat $\mu_r=1$, due to most materials of interest being non-magnetic at optical frequencies.</p>

<p>In this case, the relationship between the complex relative permittivity (also known as the complex dialectric constant) and the complex refractive index is given by</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{\mathrm{real}} + i\ \epsilon_{\mathrm{im}} = (n + i\ k)^2
\end{equation}\]

\[\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{\mathrm{real}} = n^2 - k^2
\end{equation}\]

\[\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{\mathrm{im}} = 2nk
\end{equation}\]
